  Ratio: 1:10-15 (Product:Engineering)
  
Scale-up (20-50 people):
  Product Team: 2-3 people
  Roles:
    - 1 Product Manager (strategy)
    - 1-2 Product Owners (execution)
  Ratio: 1:8-10
  
Medium Company (50-100 people):
  Product Team: 4-7 people
  Roles:
    - 1 Head of Product
    - 2-3 Product Managers

## 📚 Product Frameworks

### RICE Prioritization

```yaml
R - Reach: How many users impacted?
I - Impact: How much impact per user? (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
C - Confidence: How confident? (50%, 80%, 100%)
E - Effort: How much work? (person-weeks)

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
  Feature A: (1000 × 2 × 80%) / 4 = 400
  Feature B: (500 × 3 × 100%) / 2 = 750
  → Build Feature B first
```

```yaml
Categories:
  Must-Have (Basic):
    - Expected by users
    - Absence causes dissatisfaction
    - Example: Login functionality
  
  Performance (Linear):
    - More is better
    - Satisfaction increases linearly
    - Example: App speed
  
  Delighters (Excitement):
    - Unexpected features
    - Big satisfaction boost

  Indifferent:
    - Users don't care
    - Avoid building
  
  Reverse:
    - Users prefer without
    - Avoid building

Usage: Identify category before building
```
