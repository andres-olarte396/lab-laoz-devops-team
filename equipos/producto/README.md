## 📚 Product Frameworks

### RICE Prioritization

```yaml
R - Reach: How many users impacted?
I - Impact: How much impact per user? (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
C - Confidence: How confident? (50%, 80%, 100%)
E - Effort: How much work? (person-weeks)

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Example:
  Feature A: (1000 × 2 × 80%) / 4 = 400
  Feature B: (500 × 3 × 100%) / 2 = 750
  → Build Feature B first
```

### Kano Model

```yaml
Categories:
  Must-Have (Basic):
    - Expected by users
    - Absence causes dissatisfaction
    - Example: Login functionality
  
  Performance (Linear):
    - More is better
    - Satisfaction increases linearly
    - Example: App speed
  
  Delighters (Excitement):
    - Unexpected features
    - Big satisfaction boost
    - Example: Dark mode (when novel)
  
  Indifferent:
    - Users don't care
    - Avoid building
  
  Reverse:
    - Users prefer without
    - Avoid building

Usage: Identify category before building
```
