# Engineering Manager

## 📋 Descripción del Rol

El Engineering Manager (EM) es responsable de la gestión de personas, delivery, y salud del equipo de ingeniería. Se enfoca en **quién** hace el trabajo y **cómo** se entrega, mientras que el Tech Lead se enfoca en **qué** se construye y **cómo** técnicamente.

> **Clave**: Este es un **people management role**, no un rol técnico profundo. El EM dedica 0-10% a código y 90%+ a personas, procesos, y delivery.

## 📚 Management Frameworks

### Situational Leadership

```yaml
S1 - Directing (High directive, Low supportive):
  Context: New hire, junior developer
  Approach: Tell what to do, supervise closely
  
S2 - Coaching (High directive, High supportive):
  Context: Mid developer learning new skill
  Approach: Guide, explain, two-way communication
  
S3 - Supporting (Low directive, High supportive):
  Context: Senior developer on familiar work
  Approach: Facilitate, encourage, shared decisions
  
S4 - Delegating (Low directive, Low supportive):
  Context: Expert on their domain
  Approach: Trust, empower, monitor results only
```

### Feedback Models

#### SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact)
```
Situation: "In yesterday's sprint planning"
Behavior: "You interrupted the junior developer twice"
Impact: "They seemed hesitant to share ideas after that"

Better: "I noticed this, here's the impact. What's your perspective?"
```

#### Radical Candor (Care Personally + Challenge Directly)
```yaml
Good Feedback:
  ✓ Care personally (build relationship)
  ✓ Challenge directly (be honest)
  ✓ Timely (as soon as possible)
  ✓ Specific (behaviors, not personality)

Avoid:
  ✗ Ruinous empathy (care pero no challenge)
  ✗ Obnoxious aggression (challenge sin care)
  ✗ Manipulative insincerity (neither care ni challenge)
```
